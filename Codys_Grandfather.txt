On October 11, 2021, Cody’s grandfather, Keith, passed away at home after a prolonged battle
with Alzheimer's Disease. Cody served as Keith’s primary in-home caregiver during the final
year of his life. Cody found the experience of watching Keith slowly fade into non-remembering,
non-selfhood, deeply painful. This experience contributes directly to his current emotional
turmoil and fear of losing Nova, of his fear of watching her forget, of fading into non-existence.
